  <p>I took this photo at the Jordan River, it is of a rock with some trees in the background. The purpose of this project was to take a photo using only bare materials that would be applicable to our physics lessons. I am proud that I was able to make a photo using the camera I made, and I was able to apply my knowledge the physics of light to know how to construct it, math to know where to place it, and construction to make sure it kept all the unwanted light out.</p>

  <p id="Physics of the Pinhole Camera" class="header">Physics</p>
  <p>My camera works by having a small hole to limit the light exposure and to sharpen it like the double slit experiment by reducing the amount of light it gets from each direction, and the rest of the camera is light proof. The inside of the camera is black so that it will absorb the most amount of light, if it was white the light would be reflected onto the film and ruin the shot. The pinhole camera is not an example of reflection or refraction because the light is not bouncing off anything or going through a change of medium when it goes into the camera. When you take the picture it is capturing the different frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum (in this case visible light), and creating a picture that can transmit a black and white translation of those frequencies forever. It also shows that light is energy because it is burning the photo paper. </p>

  <p>We can find the how many inches vertically of the rock the camera can capture by taking the distance between the pinhole and the photo and the height of the photo and applying that ratio to the distance to the rock, for example 60/12*(3 + 3) = 30 which is the combination of the two halved lengths as you can see.</p>
  <p class="header">Ways to Improve</p>
  <p>Although I enjoy the photo that came out I know that it could come out more clear next time. I think I would be better at making photographs if I spent more time mastering development and learning exactly how long the film should be exposed.<br>Even though my picture wasn't perfect what I enjoyed most was that I made it myself. </p>
